[Ideas

- Create a limited map of maybe 40 rooms max
- Make rooms appear/disappear on certain conditions
- Weapons, items, and armor can give buffs/debuffs
- Chaos token idea? or use dice to determine results
- Wandering enemies, 4 fac
- customizable character, transformation items? (no, probably too hard)
