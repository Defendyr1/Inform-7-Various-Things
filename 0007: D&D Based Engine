[Ideas

- Create a limited map of maybe 20 rooms max
- Make rooms appear/disappear on certain conditions
- Weapons, items, and armor can give buffs/debuffs
- Chaos token idea? or use dice to determine results
- Wandering enemies, final boss (worm maybe), npc vendors
- A cult war? Multiple bosses? Factions?
- customizable character, transformation items? (no, probably too hard)
