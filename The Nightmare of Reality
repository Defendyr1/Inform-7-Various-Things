"The Nightmare of Reality"

Bedroom is a room.
The description of Bedroom while the player is awake is "[if the player is awake]Your old, familiar bedroom. Many memories are brought to your thinking as you glance across your room. Some clutter - well, more like beloved junk - lies about the room. It is your private sanctuary... but only when you're awake.[end if][if the player is asleep]Your old, familiar bedroom. Everything is muted into a monochromatic shade of black, grey or white. And not only that... your familiar room is rather unfamiliar. Your anxiety grows as the room slowly freezes and a sense of insidious malaise creeps in.[end if]".

A person can be awake or asleep.
A person is usually awake.

Instead of sleeping:
    if the player is awake begin;
        now the player is asleep;
        say "You decide to take a nap.";
    else;
        say "You're already asleep.";
    end if;
    try looking.

Instead of waking up:
    if the player is asleep begin;
        now the player is awake;
        say "You decide to wake up.";
    else;
        say "You're already awake.";
    end if;
    try looking.
