"The Nightmare of Reality"

When play begins:
    now the left hand status line is
        "[the player's surroundings] / [turn count]";
    now the right hand status line is "Status: [if the player is awake]Awake[else]Asleep[end if]".

RealWorld is a region. Bedroom is in RealWorld.
DreamWorld is a region. DreamBedroom is in DreamWorld

Bedroom is a room.
The description of Bedroom is "Your old, familiar bedroom. Many memories are brought to your thinking as you glance across your room. Some clutter - well, more like beloved junk - lies about the room. It is your private sanctuary... but only when you're awake.".

DreamBedroom is a room. The printed name of DreamBedroom is "Bedroom".
The description of DreamBedroom is "Your old, familiar bedroom. Although... everything is muted into a monochromatic shade of black, grey or white. Suddenly, our familiar room is rather unfamiliar. This isn't right. Your anxiety grows as the room slowly freezes and a sense of insidious malaise creeps in.".

A person can be awake or asleep.
A person is usually awake.

Instead of sleeping:
    if the player is awake begin;
        now the player is asleep;
        say "You decide to take a nap.";
        now the player is in DreamBedroom;
    else;
        say "You're already asleep.";
    end if.

Instead of waking up:
    if the player is asleep begin;
        now the player is awake;
        say "You decide to wake up.";
        now the player is in Bedroom;
    else;
        say "You're already awake.";
    end if.
