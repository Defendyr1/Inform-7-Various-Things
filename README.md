# Inform-7-Various-Things
This is just a bunch of random experiments. I wonder if anyone'll ever see this.

Manichaean Evils was a first attempt at an RPG, but the combat system fell apart.

Experimentation 1 is a way of learning the basics. It is also somewhat of an Inform reference thingy.

Desert Survival is the second attempt at a game.
