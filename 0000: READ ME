# Inform-7
This is just a bunch of random experiments. None will escape the omnipotence of obscurity.

0001 Manichaean Evils was a first attempt at an RPG, but the combat system fell apart. Failed.

0002 Experimentation 1 is a way of learning the basics. It is also somewhat of an Inform reference thingy. Failed.

0003 Desert Survival is the second attempt at a game, with a survival and rpg aspect to it. Failed.

0004 The Nightmare of Reality is a third attempt, with a dream/reality mechanic. Failed.

0005 Combat System is another attempt at a working attack/defend mechanic. Failed.

0006 Game Mechanics was an attempt at just outlining future mechanics. Failed.

0007 Experimentation 2 is finding out how to create multiple objects. Finished.

0008 D&D Engine is a new attempt at a game. Work In Progess.
