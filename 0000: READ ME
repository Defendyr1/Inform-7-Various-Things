# Inform-7
This is just a bunch of random experiments. None will escape the omnipotence of obscurity.

Manichaean Evils was a first attempt at an RPG, but the combat system fell apart.

Experimentation 1 is a way of learning the basics. It is also somewhat of an Inform reference thingy.

Desert Survival is the second attempt at a game, with a survival and rpg aspect to it.

The Nightmare of Reality is a third attempt, with a dream/reality mechanic. (WIP)

Combat System is another attempt at a working attack/defend mechanic. (WIP)
