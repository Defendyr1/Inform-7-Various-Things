"The Manichaean Evils"

[The hero quests to find the heart of the darkness and defeat for once and forever. During a pivotal moment, the hero chooses good, evil or neither. Following that, we see an epic quest for the heart of Good/Evil/both and then an epic fight]
[cleanse -neither, purify -good, corrupt -evil]
[hopefully ranged weapons, magic, armor, health]
[random enemy encounters???]

[testing goes like this btw]
test me with "withdraw / l tree / e / n / ne / n".

When play begins, say "[italic type]   Aeons ago, an epic collision between the light and darkness erupted throughout the world. Blinding or obscuring the whole world, two entities of fundamental forces began to exist with a sentience of their own. These entities sought to overwhelm the other, only to annihilate themselves. Not a bit of the others existed.[line break][line break]      However, hidden specks and seeds the forces hid grew to be more powerful, more ruthless. After that epic war, they had to overcome the other. This next fight would be more brutal. This next fight would change the rest of the world. This next fight would define millennia of the universe - subjugated to the Darkness or freed by the Light.[line break][line break]       The force of Light determined itself to be peaceful, turning the life around them into pure versions of itself, without any error or anomaly. But after the war, it decided to destroy anything impure, and forcibly heal others or 'sanitize' the world of their 'evil'. It would call its healed entities the Sanctified Seraphim.[line break][line break]       The force of Darkness was aggressive. It attacked and made the world a hard place, as hard places make harder people. After, though, the Darkness retreated, straight-up aggression was too risky against the Light. It adopted more pacifistic ideas, trying to rule people by their greatest flaws, naming its clones the Whisperers In The Darkness.[line break][line break]       But there was one who would not be dissauded from the light and the dark. The hero quested near and far, for days and weeks and months and years, until they finally found the shrine. The shrine which had an epic blade of light to turn back the Darkness that threatened to consume the world. The one star... in the night sky.".


[Starting Room, taking Excalibur, finding an exit************************]
Enchanted Shrine is a lighted room. "[if sword in stone is in Enchanted Shrine]On the small island you are standing on, you see a blade deep within a large boulder. The hilt protrudes from the sword, as if it was inviting you to take it. Large monoliths of stone surround you and the sword, covered with moss. The water outside the island is perfectly still. There is an odd looking tree off to the side. It might be worth a look.[else]The island you are standing on is a pristine glade, untouched by humanity for centuries. Large stones stand around the center of the island. Beyond the stones lay the water, deep and clear, fresh and pure. Ivy and other greenery cover the island, and an old sentinel tree stands guard over the glade.".

The sword in a stone is an object. The sword in a stone is in Enchanted Shrine. The description of The sword in a stone is "The sword has a golden hilt, and what appears to be a platinum/steel mix for a blade.
